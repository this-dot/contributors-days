      <h3>What if I have very little experience in open source?</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a senior developer and know how to contribute to open source projects but a high number of contributions but are looking to become more active, please apply.

        If you have never contributed to open source projects or are new to web development, this is not the right forum for you, but we’d love to help you get jumpstarted. Send us a note here so we can help.
