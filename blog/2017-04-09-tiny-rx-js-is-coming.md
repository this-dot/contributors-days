During the RxJS Contributor Days, Angular Core Team members raised the size of RxJS as a concern. You can listen in on the conversation and discussion in [Size & Modularity vs Ergonomics vs Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2elgbSierX0) video. 

We're happy to report that as a result of this discussion Ben Lesh decided to prioritize developing a smaller version of RxJS that will be phased in in upcoming versions of RxJS.
