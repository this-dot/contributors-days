During the RxJS Contributor Day, the Angular Core Team members raised the size of RxJS as a concern. You can the concern and 
the discussion in [Size & Modularity vs Ergonomics vs Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2elgbSierX0) video. 

We're happy to report that as a result of this discussion Ben Lesh desided to create a small version of RxJS specifically for
libraries like Angular that package RxJS as a dependency.
