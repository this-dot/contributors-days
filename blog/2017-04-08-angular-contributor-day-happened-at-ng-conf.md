We had a great day with the Angular community and Angular Core Team discussing topics raised by the community members.
No thing specific to share at the moment, but let's just say it was the best Contributor Day yet. You'll be very interested
to hear what we discussed. Sign up to be notified when Angular Contributor Day videos are ready.
