We had a great day with the Angular community and Angular Core Team discussing topics raised by community members. 

Nothing specific to share at the moment, but great momentum from community members such as Uri Goldshtein already pitching in to keep the discussions alive. 

You'll be very interested to hear what we discussed, so sign up to be notified when Angular Contributor Day videos are ready.
